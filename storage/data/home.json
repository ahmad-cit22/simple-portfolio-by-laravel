    "about": "I'm Nafis Ahmed from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I'm a full-stack web application developer who loves to learn new things and connecting with new people. I always try to be up to date with the newer technologies & never want to lag behind in grabbing them. <br> I started my web journey in 2021 by starting to learn frontend web development at Creative IT Institute, Dhaka. After that, I started learning backend development at the same institute. In the meantime, I also learned MERN stack development from Udemy (Dr. Angela Yu) which also had a great role in my learning path. I also learned plenty of things from some renowned online platforms like 'FreeCodeCamp', 'Learn with Sumit', 'Code with Harry', 'Apna College' etc. And I'm learning new things everyday. <br> Talking about my work experiences, I have worked as a Web development intern at IGP - Institute of Global Professionals before. <br> Currently I'm working as a Full-stack Web Developer at IMBD Agency Ltd. And looking forward to progress further in my professional career as a Web Developer. I have an ambition to get established as one of the top IT professionals of the country one day and working exactly for that."
